# Experimental Google code verification

AUTH-23 adds the opt-in core `google` feature and `GoogleCodeExchange`. This is a
code/identity-proof component, not supported Google web/native activation. No
Google HTTP endpoint, server setting, native browser/listener, mobile return
adapter, local-session grant or provider-deletion flow is supplied by this feature.
The [ADR](../architecture/adr/0019-google-code-flow.md) records the remaining work.

Enable `easy-auth-core/google` and use the existing PostgreSQL and server
`oidc-verification` features for the repository ports and production `OidcHttps`.
The PostgreSQL `google` feature additionally selects its existing `oidc-identities`
ports and the core Google component; it adds no Google-specific SQL or schema.
Construct the component from the exact persisted connection snapshot, the same
authoritative repository for registry/exchange checks, and an explicitly registered
Basic or Post client authentication choice:

```rust
let http = Arc::new(OidcHttps::new());
let google = GoogleCodeExchange::new(
    persisted_connection,
    repository.clone(),
    repository.clone(),
    registered_authentication,
    http.clone(),
    http,
)?;
```

Registry configuration remains trusted administrative work. Match
`OAuthTransactions` to `google.configuration()` and retain its original state,
browser/operation binding, nonce and PKCE verifier in protected transient transport.
`authorization_url(&start)` requests only fixed `openid email profile` scopes and
S256. After validating and atomically consuming the actual bound callback, pass its
opaque `OAuthExchange` and actual `OidcAuthorizationCode` to `exchange`. No API
accepts an unsolicited ID token or constructs a verified identity directly.

The component requires the exact canonical issuer `https://accounts.google.com`
and `RequireIssuer` response defense. It permits discovery-selected endpoints only
within `https://accounts.google.com`, `https://oauth2.googleapis.com` and
`https://www.googleapis.com`, using the existing constrained public-network
transport. It fixes signature policy to RS256, without additional audience trust.
Metadata must still advertise S256, response issuer support and the selected wire
authentication method. Public authentication, another issuer/defense, fallback,
caller-selected algorithms, arbitrary scopes and egress overrides are rejected.

The shared verifier requires the original nonce, exact client audience, matching
`azp` when present, bounded subject and genuine signature/time validity. The legacy
issuer spelling and cross-client hybrid presenters are not silently accepted.
Email and `email_verified` remain signed attributes, never local contact, ownership
or automatic-link authority. Missing/false verification can still identify the
signed subject; a standalone true flag without email does not establish verified
email. Duplicate, null or incorrectly typed security fields fail closed.

Only sign-in contexts are accepted. Link and provider-deletion purposes are rejected
before token POST. A verified result is the existing opaque `VerifiedOidcIdentity`,
not an issued local session; any eventual mapping/commit must retain all original
current-source, realm, owner, one-use and deadline checks. Provider `invalid_grant`
maps to Unauthorized; credential/transport/provider failures remain Unavailable.
Foreign error descriptions, tokens, codes, raw headers and private proofs must
never enter diagnostics. Cancellation/replay remains the original transaction API.

The explicit [desktop redirect metadata](oauth-transactions.md#explicit-desktop-return-metadata)
can carry an exact loopback return through the code request. It does not own a socket,
open a system browser, validate registered desktop credentials or implement mobile
return handling. Installed-client wire secrets cannot prove application authenticity.
The offline tests exercise Basic/Post requests for both HTTPS and explicit loopback
metadata, not successful registered Google/native clients.

## Evidence and remaining gates

Feature-owned offline tests use actual RS256 signatures and public JWKS with
Google-shaped discovery/code responses. They cover original code/PKCE/redirect,
fixed scope/egress/authentication, wrong claims/signature/algorithm, duplicate email
flags, email-attribute semantics, cancellation, source/purpose isolation and exact
provider-error versus infrastructure-error results. Their controlled repository is
a component fixture. Ten separate PostgreSQL scenarios now exercise the actual
Google code component through real state consumption, signature verification,
mapping and existing local identity/session commit. They cover provider-only
ownership without email merging, JIT, scoped identity ownership, callback and subject concurrency,
rollback, current-source revalidation and final-audit deadline waits. Token/JWKS
responses remain controlled offline actual-signature fixtures, not real Google or
system-browser interoperability. See the [verification history](../security/verification.md).

Before ordinary activation, AUTH-23 still needs reviewed Google callback decoding/
web transport integrated with the tested PostgreSQL flow, actual native
system-browser/OS-return handling, registered-client/manual provider evidence and a
usable genuinely fresh provider-required deletion path. This component does not
request or infer provider reauthentication: issuance time, local session rotation
and an authorization prompt cannot substitute for genuinely recent signed
`auth_time`. No weak recovery/deletion fallback is permitted. Linking, Apple grant
handling, native remote token families and broader release gates remain separate.
